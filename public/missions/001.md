# Mission // #001
## Scramble for Fortune
# Goals
- ~~Scout out the designated area for a safe location where the science team can land and settle within 12 hours. Afterwards, they will need multiple days to prepare specialized equipment for retrieval of the artifact.~~
- ~~Search for and ward off any potential threats, whether it be other parties or the environment itself. Form a perimeter around the quarry once it's in operation. We anticipate opposing forces to coordinate an attack at this critical moment.~~
  - ~~Stop any attempts from raiders to seize control of the area. Maintain strategic control of the quarry by the time the science team resurfaces.~~
- Safely escort the artifact, the team, and the equipment off the planet.
  - Their lives are more important than yours, don't forget it.
