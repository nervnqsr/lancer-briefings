# MSMC Transport Carrier - Cradle (Orbit) // 309.5017u
After a harrowing mission, the team is finally given respite and recover on their way back to **CRADLE**.
**OAXACA** requests specialized leadership training, to which **KESTREL** readily agrees. The rest of the squad rest as they look forward to the promise of their next mission being all but an excuse for a long vacation. They use this time to finetune their gear and indulge in their pastimes.
