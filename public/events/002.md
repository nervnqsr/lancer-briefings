# MSMC Transport Carrier - Cradle (Orbit) // 309.5017u
After a harrowing mission, the team is finally given respite and recover on their way back to **CRADLE**.
**OAXACA** requests specialized leadership training, to which **KESTREL** readily agrees. The rest of the squad rest as they look forward to the promise of their next mission being all but an excuse for a long vacation. They use this time to finetune their gear and indulge in their pastimes.

# Cradle (Surface) // 309.5017u
While **OVERCLOCK** remains on the carrier for the time being for additional adjustments to his equipment, the rest of the squad enter the city and immediately get to work. They assist the local police in quelling the rogue machines near the factory entrance and investigate the origin of the virus. With **OAXACA** and **WANDERER** staying to hold the line, **JANUS** and **SCAPEGOAT** trace the path back to the virus' programmer. The away team easily locate him and discover him to be a harmless man living with his mother.

The squad reconvenes and find that the **NHP** within the factory has most likely already cascaded and had modified the initial program from an innocuous prank to something much more dangerous over the past weeks, explaining the growing aggression and organization of the machines. They decide to enter the factory and dispatch the **NHP** as quickly as possible before the situation becomes even more dangerous.
