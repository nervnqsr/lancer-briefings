Immediately upon the science team's descent, hostile forces revealed themselves to surround the squad and take control of the retrieval site. Enemy melee units attempted shock tactics but were met with composed resistance and quickly disposed of. The remaining, more cautious ranged forces were then successfully held at bay in a protracted battle.

The squad suffered moderate damage after having destroyed most of the opposition. As the science team reemerged, communications with command restored with impeccable timing. Allied dropships had arrived and were prepared to receive them, but necessitated landing several kilometres off their mark in order to evade enemy anti-air.

With what little time they had bought themselves, the squad swiftly prepare for the trek ahead, with the artifact in tow and their charge to be protected.

Having successfully escorted the scientists and the artifact through the veritable gauntlet of opposing forces - and off the planet - the squad was subsequently blindsided by the arrival of an extremely high-ranking enemy Lancer, **GALAHAD**, from whom a single attack annihilated the remaining rescue vehicles at once.

Upon witnessing this, lead scientist **SCHUMACHER** hurriedly convinces his rescue pilot to open the door of their vehicle, allowing him to throw a small data device off-board and into the hands of **WANDERER**.

Surrounded by hostiles, Aun'Ist bounties on their heads, and without any recourse, the squad disengages completely and commit to a full retreat. They manage to break from their pursuers after a few hours, now finding themselves in a mountainous area, far from their initial landing point.

Safely hidden within a valley for the time being, the squad finds some time to recuperate and analyze their situation, as well as the data left to them by the science team.
